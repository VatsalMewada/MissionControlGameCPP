Hey Deep,

I've put together the project structure and provided some starter code for your project. Feel free to explore and add any extra logic that the project requires.

For compiling the program, use the make command, and I've included a make file to help with that. When you're ready to run it, just execute the command ./cardGame on your Linux system.

If you're using a different operating system, you might need to make some adjustments to the code.

Give it a shot and let me know how it goes!

Cheers,
Vatsal M.
